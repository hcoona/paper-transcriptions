Invented about 40 years ago and called ubiquitous less than 10 years
later, B-tree indexes have been used in a wide variety of computing
systems from handheld devices to mainframes and server farms. Over the
years, many techniques have been added to the basic design in order to
improve efficiency or to add functionality. Examples include separation
of updates to structure or contents, utility operations such as
non-logged yet transactional index creation, and robust query processing
such as graceful degradation during index-to-index navigation.

This survey reviews the basics of B-trees and of B-tree indexes in
databases, transactional techniques and query processing techniques
related to B-trees, B-tree utilities essential for database operations,
and many optimizations and improvements. It is intended both as a survey
and as a reference, enabling researchers to compare index innovations
with advanced B-tree techniques and enabling professionals to select
features, functions, and tradeoffs most appropriate for their data
management challenges.
